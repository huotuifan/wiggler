# wiggler
Productivity enabler; so you can be a COVID vacationer!

Simple Java program that uses java.awt.Robot to generate native system input events (mouse wiggle every 4 minutes) to simulate YOU, hard at work from your home office or wherever you're sheltering.

Run with “java -jar wiggler.jar”.
No mice were wiggled in the making of this jar.
